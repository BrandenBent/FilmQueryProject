# Film Query Project

## Overview
This project is an assignment for the Skill Distillery FullStack Java Bootcamp focussing on Object Oriented Java programming.

The overall goal of this project is to create a command line Java app that sifts through a preset MYSQL Database and performs various actions.


## Implementation
First we defined our abstract classes and our DatabaseAccessorObject that will drive our app through the MySQL Database and find the desired data. Afterward we created a menu in Java that calls these methods through a created DatabaseAccessorObject using it's methods.

## Run Through
When the program is ran the user is welcomed and they are given a choice of finding a movie by ID, finding a movie through a keyword either in it's title or description, or exiting the program. The program will run in a loop until the user decides to exit.

## Lessons Learned
This project was our my first big dive into MySQL, as well as implementing a foreign language into Java. At first I struggled to understand how Java would send commands in another language without effecting, but after continuing through the project all the information fell together and I was able to rely on my knowledge on Java to help me progress and learn MySQL.
